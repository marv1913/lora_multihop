# LoRa Interface for stream based communication
This application provides an interface to communicate over an LoRa network. The interface can be accessed using a TCP connection. So you can use streams to send data over the network. The application also implements an multihop routing protocol to send network packages over the LoRa network. 

## protocol
The protocol is an ad hoc multihop network. So you are able to build networks over long distances. Detailed specifications of the protocol can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/marv1913/lora_multihop/wiki) of this repository.
